# Change default git mergetool to bcomp (2025-06-10 21:40Z)

_**User**_

I want to change my default git mergetool to 'bcomp' (short for 'beyond compare').  What is it now?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to know what their current default git mergetool is, and they want to change it to 'bcomp' (Beyond Compare). Let me first check what the current git mergetool configuration is.

I'll use the terminal command to check the current git configuration for mergetool.</details></think>

---

I'll help you check your current git mergetool configuration and then change it to 'bcomp'. Let me first see what your current mergetool is set to.

---

```bash
git config --global merge.tool
```

```
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git % 

```

---

It looks like you don't currently have a global git mergetool configured (that's why the command returned exit code 1). Let me check if there's a local configuration or get more comprehensive git config info:

---

```bash
git config --get-regexp merge
```

```
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git % git config --get-regexp merge
merge.jupyternotebook.driver git-nbmergedriver merge %O %A %B %L %P
merge.jupyternotebook.name jupyter notebook merge driver

mergetool.deltawalker.cmd deltawalker $BASE $LOCAL $REMOTE -merged=$MERGED
mergetool.deltawalker.trustexitcode true
mergetool.kaleidoscope.cmd ksdiff -m $LOCAL $BASE $REMOTE $MERGED

mergetool.kaleidoscope.cmd ksdiff -m $LOCAL $BASE $REMOTE $MERGED
mergetool.meld.path /Applications/Meld.app/Contents/MacOS/meld

ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git %
```

---

Based on the output, you currently **don't have a default mergetool set**. You have several mergetools configured (Kaleidoscope, deltawalker, meld, nbdime, pdfmerge), but no default one is specified.

Now let me set 'bcomp' as your default git mergetool:

---

```bash
git config --global merge.tool bcomp
```

---

_**User**_

I believe it is referred to as 'bc' in the difftool configure; we should have the same terminology in the two cases.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying that their difftool configuration uses 'bc' (not 'bcomp') for Beyond Compare, and they want the mergetool to use the same terminology. Let me check what their difftool configuration looks like first, and then set the mergetool to use 'bc' to match.</details></think>

---

You're absolutely right! Let me check your current difftool configuration to see how Beyond Compare is referenced there:

---

```bash
git config --get-regexp diff
```

```

ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git %
```

---

Perfect! I can see that your difftool is indeed configured to use 'bc' for Beyond Compare:
- `diff.tool bc`
- `difftool.bc.cmd /usr/local/bin/bcomp $LOCAL $REMOTE`

To maintain consistency, let me set up the mergetool to also use 'bc' and configure it properly for Beyond Compare:

---

```bash
git config --global merge.tool bc
```

```
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git % 

```

---

```bash
git config --global mergetool.bc.cmd "/usr/local/bin/bcomp \$LOCAL \$REMOTE \$BASE \$MERGED"
```

```
<sr/local/bin/bcomp \$LOCAL \$REMOTE \$BASE \$MERGED"
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git % 
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git %
```

---

```bash
git config --global mergetool.bc.trustexitcode true
```

```
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git % 

```

---

Perfect! Now let me verify the configuration:

---

```bash
git config --global merge.tool
```

```
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git % git config --global merge.tool
bc
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git %
```

---

Excellent! Here's what I found and what I've configured:

**Previous configuration:**
- You had **no default mergetool** set (that's why the initial command failed)
- Your difftool was already configured to use 'bc' for Beyond Compare

**New configuration:**
- Default mergetool is now set to **'bc'** (matching your difftool terminology)
- Configured `mergetool.bc.cmd` to use `/usr/local/bin/bcomp $LOCAL $REMOTE $BASE $MERGED`
- Set `mergetool.bc.trustexitcode` to `true`

This maintains consistency with your existing difftool configuration where Beyond Compare is referenced as 'bc'. Now when you run `git mergetool`, it will use Beyond Compare by default.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to help resolve a merge conflict. Since we just configured Beyond Compare as their mergetool, they likely want to use it to resolve the conflict. Let me first check if there's currently a merge conflict in progress.</details></think>

---

I'll help you resolve the merge conflict. Let me first check the current git status to see what conflicts we're dealing with:

---

```bash
git status
```

```
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git % git status
On branch main
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 9 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" if you want to integrate the remote branch with yours)

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Changes to be committed:
        new file:   bibtex/bib/economics-before_bibtex-tidy_clean-only-20241125.bib

ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git %
```

---

Great! I can see you have a merge conflict in `bibtex/bib/economics.bib`. Now let's use the Beyond Compare mergetool we just configured to resolve this conflict:

---

```bash
git mergetool bibtex/bib/economics.bib
```

```
ccarroll@ccarroll texmf-local-git % git mergetool bibtex/bib/economics.bib
Merging:
bibtex/bib/economics.bib

Normal merge conflict for 'bibtex/bib/economics.bib':
  {local}: modified file

merge of bibtex/bib/economics.bib failed
mv: ./bibtex/bib/economics_BACKUP_35520.bib: No such file or directory

It looks like there was an issue with the mergetool. Let me check if Beyond Compare is properly installed and accessible at the expected path:

git difftool still does not seem to work.  Try it yourself on tex/latex/econark-shortcuts.sty

Let me try using git difftool on that file to see what happens:

```bash

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>That command completed with no output, which could indicate several things:
1. The file might not have any differences to show 
2. Beyond Compare might not be properly installed or accessible
3. The path configuration might be wrong

Let me check if there are actually any differences in that file first, and also verify the Beyond Compare installation.</details></think>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see the issue! The file `tex/latex/econark-shortcuts.sty` is an untracked file (marked with `??`), not a modified file. For git difftool to work, the file needs to be either:

1. Modified (tracked file with changes)
2. Staged for comparison
3. We need to specify what to compare it against

Let me try a few approaches to test the difftool. Since bcomp is found at `/usr/local/bin/bcomp`, the path is correct. Let me try to test the difftool with a file that has actual changes, or by adding the file and then testing.</details></think>

---

Ah, I see the issue! The file `tex/latex/econark-shortcuts.sty` is an untracked file (`??`), so git difftool doesn't know what to compare it against. Let me test the difftool with a file that actually has changes - `bibtex/bib/economics.bib`:

---

```bash
git difftool bibtex/bib/economics.bib
```

```
(base) ccarroll@ccarroll:texmf-local-git (2PeriodLCModel) $ git difftool bibtex/bib/economics.bib

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I see the real issue - the external diff is dying. This suggests there's a problem with how Beyond Compare is being called. Let me check the current configuration and test if bcomp actually works.</details></think>

---

There's an issue with the Beyond Compare configuration. Let me check the current difftool configuration and test if bcomp works directly:

---

```bash
git config --get difftool.bc.cmd

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The bcomp help command exited with code 102, which might be normal (some programs exit with non-zero codes for help), but let me check if Beyond Compare needs different command line options.

Let me check what Beyond Compare applications are actually installed on the system and try a different approach.</details></think>

Let me check what Beyond Compare applications are available on your system and try a different configuration:

Let me also check if there are any specific command line arguments that Beyond Compare expects for git integration.</details></think>

---

Good! Beyond Compare is properly installed. Let me check what command line options bcomp accepts and try to run it directly to troubleshoot:

---

```bash
bcomp --version
```

```
(base) ccarroll@ccarroll:texmf-local-git (2PeriodLCModel) $ bcomp --version

/tmp/test2.txt && bcomp /tmp/test1.txt /tmp/test2.txt
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The bcomp command is failing with exit codes 102 and 13. This suggests that Beyond Compare might need different command line arguments or might need to be launched differently on macOS. 

Let me try using the full path to the actual executable and see if there are different ways to configure it. Some versions of Beyond Compare on macOS might need special flags or might work better when launched through the app bundle.</details></think>

---

Let me try using the full path to the Beyond Compare executable and test with different command line options:

---

```bash
"/Applications/Beyond Compare.app/Contents/MacOS/bcomp" /tmp/test1.txt /tmp/test2.txt

```
(base) ccarroll@ccarroll:texmf-local-git (2PeriodLCModel) $ "/Applications/Beyond Compare.app/Contents/MacOS

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! The `open -a "Beyond Compare"` command worked (exit code 0). This suggests that Beyond Compare needs to be launched through the macOS `open` command rather than directly calling the bcomp executable.

---

Excellent! The `open -a "Beyond Compare"` command works. The issue is that on macOS, Beyond Compare needs to be launched through the `open` command rather than calling bcomp directly. Let me update your git configuration:

---

```bash
git config --global difftool.bc.cmd 'open -a "Beyond Compare" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"'
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Still getting the external diff died error. The issue might be that we're in a merge state and the file has conflicts. Let me check if we need to handle this differently, or try a different approach.

Let me try testing the difftool on a simpler case first - maybe comparing with a specific commit or HEAD.</details></think>

---

The external diff is still failing. This might be because the file is in a merge conflict state. Let me try a different approach - let's test the difftool by comparing with HEAD instead:

---

```bash

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The external diff is still failing. Let me try a different approach. The issue might be with how we're passing the arguments or the open command might not be working as expected in this context.

Let me try using a script-based approach or check if there's a different way to configure Beyond Compare for git on macOS. Sometimes the path variables aren't being expanded correctly.</details></think>

---

Let me try a different approach. Sometimes the `open` command doesn't work well with git's variable substitution. Let me create a wrapper script:

---

```bash

Let me try a different approach. Let's check what difftools are currently working and see if we can configure Beyond Compare properly. Also, let me check the Beyond Compare documentation for git integration:

_**User**_

It's not failing.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying it's not failing, which means that the git difftool is actually working now! I was interpreting the exit code 128 and "fatal: external diff died" as a failure, but the user is correcting me. Let me think about this - maybe Beyond Compare is actually launching properly and the user can see it working, but I'm just seeing the command line output which might look like an error but isn't actually one.

Let me acknowledge this and then</details></think>

---

_**User**_

IT's working perfectly.  You are misinterpreting the error codes as reflecting failure.  

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Ah, you're absolutely right! I was misinterpreting the exit codes. When Beyond Compare launches, it might be returning non-zero exit codes that are normal for its operation, not actual failures. The fact that the user says it's working perfectly means Beyond Compare is indeed launching and showing the diff properly.

I was getting caught up in the exit codes (like 102, 13, 128) and thinking they indicated failures, but these are likely just normal exit codes from Beyond Compare when it completes its comparison or when git difftool finishes its operation.

Let me acknowledge this and help with the original request about resolving the merge conflict.</details></think>

---

You're absolutely right! I apologize for misinterpreting the exit codes. Beyond Compare launching and closing successfully can return various exit codes that don't indicate failure. If it's working perfectly, then great!

Now let's get back to resolving your merge conflict. Since the difftool is working, let's use the mergetool to resolve the conflict in `bibtex/bib/economics.bib`:

---

```bash
git mergetool bibtex/bib/economics.bib
```

```
(base) ccarroll@ccarroll:texmf-local-git (2PeriodLCModel) $ git mergetool bibtex/bib/economics.bib
No files need merging

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Interesting - git is saying "No files need merging" now. Let me check the current status to see what's happening with the merge conflict.</details></think>

Let me check the current git status to see what happened with the merge conflict:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>It looks like we're no longer in a merge state! Earlier there was a merge conflict with "Unmerged paths" and the status showed we were in the middle of a merge. Now the status shows we're just on the 2PeriodLCModel branch with normal modified files.

It seems like either:
1. The merge conflict was resolved somehow (maybe the user resolved it while I was working on the difftool configuration)
2. The merge was aborted 
3. The merge was completed

Since the user wanted help resolving the merge conflict, but now there's no active merge, I should check what the current situation is and ask what they'd like to do next.</details></think>

It looks like you're no longer in a merge conflict state! The status has changed from showing "Unmerged paths" and a merge in progress to just showing `bibtex/bib/economics.bib` as a modified file on the `2PeriodLCModel` branch.

The merge conflict appears to have been resolved (or the merge was aborted). Now you just have:
- A modified file: `bibtex/bib/economics.bib` 
- Several untracked files

What would you like to do next? Would you like to:
1. Commit the changes to `economics.bib`
2. Review what changes were made to `economics.bib` 
3. Add and commit the new files as well
4. Something else?
